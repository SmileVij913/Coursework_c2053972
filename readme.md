GLYCOLYSIS AND CITRIC ACID CYCLE SIMULATION

OVERVIEW
This Python script simulates the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle(Krebs cycle) to predict the concentrations of key metabolites over time. Glycolysis is the initial metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose into pyruvate, while the citric acid cycle further metabolizes pyruvate to produce energy-rich molecules such as ATP and NADH.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this simulation is to provide insights into the dynamics of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, which are fundamental processes in cellular metabolism.By modelling the changes in metabolite concentrations over time, we can better understand how these pathways respond to various conditions and perturbations.

FEATURES
> Simulates glycolysis and the citric acid cycle simultaneously.
> Tracks the concentrations of metabolites including glucose, ATP, ADP, NADH, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, citrate, etc.
> Uses simplified rate equations to model the kinetics of each reaction.
> Provides visualisations of metabolite concentrations over time using Matplotlib.

USAGE
>Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.9 recommended).
>Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib
>Clone or download the repository containing the script
glycolysis_citric_cycle_simulation.py.
> Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
> Run the script using the command:
python glycolysis_citric_cycle_simulation
The simulation will generate plots showing the concentrations of metabolites over time for glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.

CUSTOMIZATION

We can modify the initial concentrations of metabolites to simulate different starting conditions.
We can also adjust the rate equations and parameters to explore the effects of enzyme kinetics and regulatory mechanisms.
We can extend the script if we want to incorporate additional metabolic pathways.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This simulation script was created as a part of my assignment.
The rate equations and parameters used in the simulation are simplified representations inspired by biochemical processes.
